# Lab 28 - Cars

In this lab you will be using inheritance to create a basic Car as well as more specialized cars based using the base class of Car.

Follow the instructions in the 3 .py files to create the ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) subclass, the Electric subclass, and test them all in the main.py program.

There are no tests; I will be testing this manually.
